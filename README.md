London_Bus_Safety_Data_Visualization 
The London Bus Safety data visualization project covers incidents reported from January 2015 to September 2018. This interactive dashboard offers key insights into bus safety, allowing users to explore incident data by borough, incident type, and route. The primary focus is on borough-wise incident counts, highlighting Westminster, Southwark, and Lambeth as the areas with the highest reported incidents. Users can also investigate specific incident types, such as slip-trip-fall onboard injuries, personal injuries, collisions, and assaults. Temporal analysis reveals trends over time, showing a gradual decrease in incidents from 2015 to 2018. Additionally, the visualization captures seasonal variations, and a TreeMap provides a concise overview of incidents by borough. The project features a user-friendly interface, enabling stakeholders to interact with the data and gain insights into the safety aspects of London buses during the specified period.
